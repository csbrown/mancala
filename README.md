mancala
=======

A mancala solver in c for the sake of thinking about the problem.  This is designed to parse the mancala game tree and return the player with a win.  Brute Force, so I don't recommend attempting to do this on more than the tiniest of mancala boards...

mancala.c is the solver
mancala.py is a mancala game that I made for the sake of playing to develop strategies in my head brain.  Requires 2 players.
